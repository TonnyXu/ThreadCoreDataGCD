This is a sample app originally from Apple's sample code "ThreadCoreData"

The original sample app uses NSOperation for multithread processing. This one using GCD instead.

A simple rule to remember when using GCD+CoreData is allocating the MOC at the vary beginning of the GCD block. 

Be more specifically,
----------
1) Create a new queue for MOC object.
2) Init the MOC object at the very beginning block.
3) Load the data in another queue using NSURLConnection.
4) Parse the data in a third queue if necessary.
5) Update or save the MOC in the current_queue.
6) Using the MOCDidSaveNotification genereated by system to update the MOC in main queue.

Notice
----------
The master branch is the original source code from Apple
The GCD branch the using GCD.
